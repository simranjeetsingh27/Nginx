cd /usr/share/nginx/html - This is the default path where nginx is taking files from. we can make any path here before html and we can do location based routing.
The path which we mention here should be the same in /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf 



Nginx default.conf file config 



server {
    listen       80 default_server;
    server_name  localhost;

    #access_log  /var/log/nginx/host.access.log  main;

    location / {
        root   /usr/share/nginx/psponline;
        index  index.html index.htm;
    }

    location /onlineadmin {
        alias /usr/share/nginx/onlineadmin;
        index  index.html index.htm;
    }

    location / {
        root   /usr/share/nginx2/mpassport/;
        try_files $uri /public/index.html;
    }


*onlineadmin is path based routing
